uthenticate
Authenticate method will return the Token ID that needs to be echoed back in every subsequent request. In case of session expiry or log outs, the authenticate method needs to be called again and the updated Token ID needs to be passed in every subsequent request.

Password will be change by API team in Test Environment and in Live API,Mr.Gaurav Khanna/Ms Pavneet Kaur will do the same.

Points To Remember for Token ID:

Generate single token in a day as it is valid for 24 hours (00:00 AM to 11:59 PM), so generate a token at 12:03 AM and it can be used up to 11:58       PM same day.
At 12:00 AM, if the token value is being used of previous day in any ongoing booking, do not worry it can be used until booking is completed.
After 12:02 AM no booking can be started with previous day’s token value.
Do not generate token id with every search.
