SSR
This method is used to obtain the online prices of Special Service Request like Excess Baggage and Meal for LCC airlines like Indigo, Spice Jet, Air Asia, Air Arabia, Fly Dubai, etc. For LCC Airlines which currently do not support online SSR requests, the SSR request will not return Excess Baggage and meal charges. To avail excess baggage and meal services, the selected baggage and meal needs to be passed in the ticket request with the applicable price. The total price deducted during ticketing would be addition of Offered Fare + Excess Baggage and Meal Charges.

This method is also accessed to get available meal and seat options for Non LCC airlines. For Non LCC carriers the meal and seat options received in the SSR response are indicative only and may be added in the ticket request for availing the same. The given information is passed to the GDS/ airline and depending on the availability, the same is provided to the customer. Non LCC airlines do not provide online confirmation for the meal and seat option selected by the customer.

NOTE : In case of Fly Dubai and all the International LCC, the free baggage should be added from the SSR response to the ticket request then only you will be able to to avail yourself with the benefit. If in case the free baggage is not selected from SSR response with Price node 0 then no free or default baggage would be provided from the airline end. For Ex : 20 kg, 30 kg and 40 kg baggage are included in the fare only until and unless you will not select the this baggage in the ticket request you will not be able to avail yourself with the same.

NOTE : In case of return sector, if you need to have baggage only for one segment in that case you need to add both the objects for inbound and outbound in an array format.

    Air Amendment
Method Structure

Please consider below points for clarification:

Air Amendment is to buy baggage, meal or seat after Ticket is created. As of now special service is not included in amendment.
If baggage is already added for a specific pax while booking the PNR then baggage for the same pax canâ€™t be bought through air amendment.
As of now air amendment is only available for LCC carriers i.e. Indigo, Spice jet, Akasa, AirIndiaExpress, AirAsia, Jazeera and FlyDubai.
Air Amendment can be done as many as times you want after ticketing.
In Amendment, Invoice will be generated per passenger.
If meal and baggage is bought in amendment of a passenger at the same time then the invoice will be the same for both, but if meal and baggage is bought for the same passenger but in different time then invoice of them will be different.

SR FAQ
How to use SSR method in air API

Solution:This method is used to obtain the online prices of Special Service Request like Excess Baggage and Meal for LCC airlines like Indigo, Spice Jet, Air Asia, Air Arabia, Fly Dubai, etc. For LCC Airlines which currently do not support online SSR requests, the SSR request will not return Excess Baggage and meal charges. To avail excess baggage and meal services, the selected baggage and meal needs to be passed in the ticket request with the applicable price. The total price deducted during ticketing would be addition of Offered Fare + Excess Baggage and Meal Charges. This method is also accessed to get available meal and seat options for Non LCC airlines. For Non LCC carriers the meal and seat options received in the SSR response are indicative only and may be added in the ticket request for availing the same. The givenÃ¢â‚¬Â¯information is passed to the GDS/ airline and depending on the availability, the same is provided to the customer. Non LCC airlines do not provide online confirmation for the meal and seat option selected by the customer.
